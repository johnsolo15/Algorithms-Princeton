<center>Frequently Asked Questions</center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p><b>Where are the textbook libraries <code>stdlib.jar</code> and <code>algs4.jar</code>?</b>
If you took <em>Algorithms Part I</em>, you should already have them installed.
Otherwise, you can download them from
<a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/">the booksite</a>.
This page also contains links to all of the APIs.

</p><p><b> Can I read the synset or hypernym file twice?</b>
No, file i/o is very expensive so 
please read each file only once and store it in an appropriate data structure.

</p><p><b>Any advice on how to read in and parse the synset and hypernym data files?</b>
Use the <code>readLine()</code> method in our <code>In</code> library to read
in the data one line at a time.
Use the <code>split()</code> method in Java's <code>String</code> library
to divide a line into fields. You can find an example using <code>split()</code> in 
<a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/25applications/Domain.java.html">Domain.java</a>.
Use <code>Integer.parseInt()</code> 
to convert string id numbers into integers.

</p><p><b>It takes a very long time to read in the input files in DrJava. What should I do?</b>
Use the command line. DrJava incurs substantial overhead with input and output.

</p><p><b>What assumption can I make about the digraph G passed to the SAP constructor?</b>
It can be any digraph, not necessarily a DAG.


</p><p><b>What data structure(s) should I use to store the synsets, synset ids, and hypernyms?</b>
This part of the assignment is up to you. You must carefully select data structures
to achieve the specified performance requirements.

</p><p><b>Do I need to store the glosses?</b>
No, you won't use them on this assignment.

</p><p><b>Can I use my own Digraph class?</b>
No, it must have the same API as our
<a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42directed/Digraph.java.html">Digraph.java</a>
class; otherwise, you are changing the API to the SAP constructor (which takes a 
<code>Digraph</code> argument). Do not submit <code>Digraph.java</code>.

</p><p><b>Should I re-implement breadth-first search in my SAP class?</b>
It depends. You are free to call the relevant methods in
<a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42directed/BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java.html">BreadthFirstDirectedPaths.java</a>.
However, you can improve performance by several orders of magnitude by implementing it yourself, optimizing
it for repeated calls with the same digraph. (See the optional optimization section below.)
If you choose to implement your own version of BFS, give it a different name, e.g., 
<code>DeluxeBFS.java</code>, and submit it.

</p><p><b> I understand how to compute the <code>length(int v, int w)</code> method
in time proportional to <em>E</em> + <em>V</em>
but my <code>length(Iterable&lt;Integer&gt; v, Iterable&lt;Integer&gt; w)</code>
method takes time proportional to <em>a</em> × <em>b</em> × (<em>E</em> + <em>V</em>),
where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are the sizes of the two iterables. How can
I improve it to be proportional to <em>E</em> + <em>V</em>?</b>
The key is using the constructor in <code>BreadthFirstDirectedPaths</code> that 
takes an iterable of sources instead of using a single source.


</p><p><b>Is a vertex considered an ancestor of itself?</b>
Yes.

</p><p><b>What is the root synset for the WordNet DAG?</b>

</p><blockquote><pre>38003,entity,that which is perceived or known or inferred to have its own distinct existence (living or nonliving) 
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Can a noun appear in more than one synset?</b>
Absolutely. It will appear once for each meaning that the noun has.
For example, here are all of the entries in <code>synsets.txt</code>
that include the noun <code>word</code>.

</p><blockquote><pre>35532,discussion give-and-take word,an exchange of views on some topic; "we had a good discussion"; "we had a word or two about it"
56587,news intelligence tidings word,new information about specific and timely events; "they awaited news of the outcome"
59267,parole word word_of_honor,a promise; "he gave his word"
59465,password watchword word parole countersign,a secret word or phrase known only to a restricted group; "he forgot the password"
81575,word,a string of bits stored in computer memory; "large computers use words up to 64 bits long"
81576,word,a verbal command for action; "when I give the word, charge!"
81577,word,a brief statement; "he didn't say a word about it"
81578,word,a unit of language that native speakers can identify; "words are the blocks from which sentences are made"; "he hardly said ten words all morning"
</pre></blockquote>

<p><b>Can a synset consist of exactly one noun?</b>
Yes. Moreover, there can be several different synsets that consist of the same noun.

</p><blockquote><pre>62,Aberdeen,a town in western Washington  
63,Aberdeen,a town in northeastern South Dakota  
64,Aberdeen,a town in northeastern Maryland  
65,Aberdeen,a city in northeastern Scotland on the North Sea  
</pre></blockquote>

<!--
<p><b>Can two synsets have identical glosses?</b>
Yes. In such cases, <code>glosses()</code> should include a copy of each.

<blockquote><pre>
23104,barley barleycorn,a grain of barley  
23108,barleycorn,a grain of barley  
</pre></blockquote>


<p><b>Some of the glosses have example sentences at the end. What is this?</b>
The example sentence is considered to be part of the gloss.
You shouldn't need to do anything special to handle it.
-->

<p><b>I'm an ontologist and I noticed that your 
<code>hypernyms.txt</code> file contains both <em>is-a</em> and
<em>is-instance-of</em> relationships.</b>
Yes, you caught us. This ensures that every noun (except entity)
has a hypernym. Here is an article on the 
<a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/checklists/wordnet-instances.pdf">subtle distinction</a>.

<!--
<p><b>In WordNet, what should <code>glosses()</code> do if the input argument
is not a wordnet noun?</b>
Return an <code>Iterable&lt;String&gt;</code> that has zero elements.
-->

</p><p><b>How can I make the data type <code>SAP</code> immutable?</b>
You can (and should) save the associated digraph in an instance variable.
However, because our <code>Digraph</code> data type is mutable,
you must first make a defensive copy by calling the copy constructor.

</p><p><b>What should <code>sap()</code>, <code>ancestor()</code>, or <code>outcast()</code>
return if there is a tie for shortest ancestral path or outcast?</b>                    
The API does not specify, so you are free to return any such
ancestor or outcast.


</p><p><b>Do I need to throw exceptions explicitly with a throw statement?</b>
No, it's fine if they are thrown implicitly, e.g., you can rely on any
method in
<a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/42directed/Digraph.java.html">Digraph.java</a>
to throw a <code>java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException</code>
if passed a vertex argument outside of the prescribed range.
A good API documents the requisite behavior for all possible arguments,
but you should not need much extra code to deal with these corner cases.

<p>
<STRONG>Input and output.</STRONG>
We encourage you to create your own (possibly pathological)
inputs to help test your program. If your datasets create problems
for other programs (or ours!), we'll award extra credit.
The input should be very small, and
it should expose a potential flaw that other programs are likely to face.
In your readme.txt, you should describe what the input is testing.
-->

</p><p><b>Some examples.</b>
Here are some interesting examples that you can use in your code.

</p><ul>


<p></p><li>
<!-- <font color=green>This example illustrates the use of Iterable:  
[wayne s14] what does it have to do with Iterable?
 -->

<p>The SAP for <code>worm</code> and <code>bird</code> is <code>"animal animate_being beast brute creature fauna"</code>
with a distance of 5. Other common ancestors of <code>worm</code> and <code>bird</code>
with longer distances are: <code>"person individual someone somebody mortal soul"</code>
and <code>"instrumentality instrumentation"</code>.

The synsets that contain <code>worm</code> are:
</p><blockquote><pre>81679 worm
81680 worm
81681 worm
81682 worm louse insect dirt_ball
</pre></blockquote>

<p>The synsets that contain <code>bird</code> are:

</p><blockquote><pre>24306 bird
24307 bird fowl
25293 boo hoot Bronx_cheer hiss raspberry razzing razz snort bird
33764 dame doll wench skirt chick bird
70067 shuttlecock bird birdie shuttle
</pre></blockquote>


<p></p></li><li>The synset <code>municipality</code> has two paths to <code>region</code>.
<blockquote><pre>municipality -&gt; administrative_district -&gt; district -&gt; region
municipality -&gt; populated_area -&gt; geographic_area -&gt; region
</pre></blockquote>

<p></p></li><li> The synsets <code>individual</code> and <code>edible_fruit</code>
have several different paths to their common ancestor
<code>physical_entity</code>.
    
<blockquote><pre>individual -&gt; organism being -&gt; living_thing animate_thing -&gt; whole unit -&gt; object physical_object -&gt; physical_entity
person individual someone somebody mortal soul -&gt; causal_agent cause causal_agency -&gt; physical_entity
edible_fruit -&gt; garden_truck -&gt; food solid_food -&gt; solid -&gt; matter -&gt; physical_entity
edible_fruit -&gt; fruit -&gt; reproductive_structure -&gt; plant_organ -&gt; plant_part -&gt; natural_object -&gt; unit -&gt; object -&gt; physical_entity
</pre></blockquote>




<p></p></li><li> The following pairs of nouns are very far apart:
<blockquote><pre>(distance = 23) white_marlin, mileage
(distance = 33) Black_Plague, black_marlin
(distance = 27) American_water_spaniel, histology
(distance = 29) Brown_Swiss, barrel_roll
</pre></blockquote>

</li><li> The following synset has many paths to <code>entity</code>.
<blockquote><pre>Ambrose Saint_Ambrose St._Ambrose
</pre></blockquote>

</li><li> Also, we encourage you to use the small collection of sample files in the ftp directory.

<p>
</p></li><li> The  number of nouns in <code>synsets.txt</code> is 119,188.

</li></ul>

</p><p>

</p><ul>

<p></p><li> Download <a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/wordnet-testing.zip">wordnet-testing.zip</a>.
It contains sample input files for testing
 <code>SAP</code>, <code>WordNet</code>, and <code>Outcast</code>.

<p></p></li><li>
Create the data type <code>SAP</code>.
First, think carefully about designing a correct and efficient
algorithm for computing the shortest ancestral path.
Consult a staff member if you're unsure.
In addition to the <code>digraph*.txt</code> files, 
design small DAGs to test and debug your code.
Modularize by sharing common code.

<p></p></li><li>
Read in and parse the files described in the assignment, <code>synsets.txt</code> 
and <code>hypernyms.txt</code>.
Don't worry about storing the data in any data structures yet.
Test that you are parsing the input correctly before proceeding.

<p></p></li><li>
Create a data type <code>WordNet</code>. Divide the constructor into
two (or more) subtasks (private methods).
<ul>  
<p></p><li> Read in the <code>synsets.txt</code> file and build
appropriate data structures.
Record the number of synsets for later use.

<p></p></li><li> Read in the <code>hypernyms.txt</code> file and build a
<code>Digraph</code>. For this input, your digraph should have
82,192 vertices and 84,505 edges (but do not hardwire either of
these numbers into your program because it must work for
any valid input files).
   
</li>
</ul>

</li><li><p> Implement the remaining <code>WordNet</code> methods.
</p></li><li><p> Implement <code>Outcast</code>.

<!--
<p><li> Add the method <code>isNoun()</code> and <code>glosses()</code>.
If you chose appropriate data structures when parsing
<code>synsets.txt</code>, this step will be relatively easy.

<p>
Try some nouns that participate in many synsets, e.g., <code>run</code>, <code>face</code> and 
<code>back</code>.
-->

<center>Optional Optimizations</center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>
There are a few things you can do to speed up a sequence of SAP computations on
the same digraph. Do not attempt to do this or any of your own invention without
thoroughly testing your code. You can gain bonus points for correctly implementing
some of these optimizations but you risk losing more points than you can gain
if you introduce bugs that render your solution no longer correct.

</p><ul>
<p></p><li> The bottleneck operation is re-initializing arrays of length <em>V</em> to
perform the BFS computations. This must be done once for the first BFS computation,
but if you keep track of which array entries change, you can reuse the same 
array from computation to computation (re-initializing only those
entries that changed in the previous computation).
This leads to a dramatic savings when only a small number of entries change
(and this is the typical case for the wordnet digraph).
Note that if you have any other loops that iterates through all of the vertices,
then you must eliminate those to achieve a sublinear running time.
(An alternative is to replace the arrays with symbol tables, where, in constant time,
the constructor initializes the value associated with every key to be null.)


<p></p></li><li> If you run the two breadth-first searches from <em>v</em> and <em>w</em> 
in lockstep (alternating back and forth between exploring vertices in each of
the two searches),
then you can terminate the BFS from <em>v</em> (or <em>w</em>) as soon as the distance exceeds
the length of the best ancestral path found so far.

<p></p></li><li> Implement a software cache of recently computed <code>length()</code> and
<code>ancestor()</code> queries.
