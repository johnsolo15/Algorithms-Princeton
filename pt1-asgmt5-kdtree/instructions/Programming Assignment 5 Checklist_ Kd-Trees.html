</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

<!--
<p><b>
Can I add extra public methods to the <code>Point2D</code> and <code>RectHV</code>
APIs?</b>
You are permitted (and encouraged) to add a <code>main()</code> test client, 
but you may not add any other public methods.

<p><b>Is a point on the boundary of a rectangle considered inside it?
Do two rectangle intersect if they have just one point in common?</b>
Yes, and yes.
<p><b>What should be the format of the toString() methods in RectHV?</b>
These methods are primarily for debuginng, so any reasonable format is fine.
We recommend <code>[xmin, xmax] x [ymin, ymax]</code>.

<p><b>Can I assume that the arguments to methods in <code>RectHV</code> are not null?</b>
You can assume that the arguments to <code>contains()</code>, <code>intersects()</code>,
<code>distanceTo()</code>, and <code>distanceSquaredTo()</code> are not null.
However, if the argument to <code>equals()</code> is null, you must return
false to obey the contract.
You can also assume that none of the arguments to the constructor are 
<code>Double.NaN</code>.

<p><b>My implementation of <code>distanceTo()</code> in <code>RectHV</code> has
numerous cases. Am I on the right track?</b>
This is acceptable provided you handle every possible case.
However, there is a direct approach that requires about 6 lines of code.
-->

</p><p><b>What should I do if a point has the same x-coordinate as the point
in a node when inserting / searching in a 2d-tree?</b>
Go the right subtree as specified.


<!--
<p><b>When do I need private methods?</b>
Private methods are useful for keeping your code organized. One common organizational scheme
is to recursively call private methods. See page 399 of the book or the code for BST.java.
For example, the public <code>insert()</code> method for KdTree is best implemented using a supporting
private <code>insert()</code> method which is called recursively. As with BST, this private method
will have more arguments than the public method. Part of the assignment is deciding what arguments
are needed.
-->

</p><p><b>Can I assume that all x- or y-coordinates of points inserted into
the <code>KdTree</code>  will be between 0 and 1?</b>
Yes. You may also assume that the <code>insert()</code>, <code>contains()</code>, and 
<code>nearest()</code> methods in <code>KdTree</code> 
are passed points with x- and y-coordinates between 0 and 1.
You may also assume that the <code>range()</code> method in <code>KdTree</code> is
passed a rectangle that lies in the unit box.
<!-- However, the <code>RectHV</code> data type should not make such assumptions. -->

</p><p><b>What should I do if a point is inserted twice in the data structure?</b>
The data structure represents a <em>set</em> of points, so you should keep only one copy.


</p><p><b>How should I scale the coordinate system when drawing?</b>
Don't, please keep the default range of 0 to 1.


</p><p><b>How should I set the size and color of the points and rectangles when drawing?</b>
<!--
Your <code>RectHV</code> data types should draw lines using <code>StdDraw.line()</code> 
or <code>StdDraw.rectangle()</code>, without calling 
<code>StdDraw.setPenColor()</code> or <code>StdDraw.setPenRadius()</code>.
In <em>client code</em> (such as the <code>draw()</code> method in <code>KdTree</code>),
 -->
Use <code>StdDraw.setPenColor(StdDraw.BLACK)</code> and <code>StdDraw.setPenRadius(0.01)</code> before
before drawing the points;
use <code>StdDraw.setPenColor(StdDraw.RED)</code> or <code>StdDraw.setPenColor(StdDraw.BLUE)</code>
and <code>StdDraw.setPenRadius()</code> before drawing the splitting lines.

</p><p><b>What should <code>range()</code> return if there are no points in the range?</b>
It should return an <code>Iterable&lt;Point2D&gt;</code> object with zero points.

</p><p><b>How much memory does a <code>Point2D</code> object use?</b>
For simplicity, assume that each <code>Point2D</code> object uses 32 bytes—in reality,
it uses a bit more because of the <code>Comparator</code> instance variables.

</p><p><b>How much memory does a <code>RectHV</code> object use?</b>
You can look at the code and analyze it.

</p><p><b>I run out of memory when running some of the large sample files. What should I do?</b>
Be sure to ask Java for additional memory,
e.g., <code>java -Xmx1600m RangeSearchVisualizer input1M.txt</code>.

</p><p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr align="left">
<td bgcolor="000000">
<font size="+0" face="helvetica" color="ffffff">
<center><b>Testing</b></center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p><b>Testing.</b>
A good way to test <code>KdTree</code> is to perform
the same sequence of operations on both the <code>PointSET</code> and 
<code>KdTree</code> data types and identify any discrepancies.
The sample clients
 <a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/kdtree/RangeSearchVisualizer.java">RangeSearchVisualizer.java</a>
and 
 <a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/kdtree/NearestNeighborVisualizer.java">NearestNeighborVisualizer.java</a>
take this approach.

</p><p><b>Sample input files.</b>
&nbsp;
The directory <a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/kdtree">kdtree</a> contains
some sample input files in the specified format.
For convenience, <a href="http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/testing/kdtree-testing.zip">kdtree-testing.zip</a>
contains all of these files bundled together. 

</p><ul>
<p></p><li><code>circleN.txt</code> contains <code>n</code> points on the circumference
of the circle centered on (0.5, 0.5) of radius 0.5.

</li></ul>

The result of calling <code>draw()</code> on the points in <code>circle10.txt</code>
should look like the following:

<br><blockquote>
<img src="./Programming Assignment 5 Checklist_ Kd-Trees_files/circle10.png" width="300">
</blockquote>

<br>If <code>nearest()</code> is called with <code>p = (0.81, 0.30)</code> the number of nodes visited in order
to find that F is nearest is 5.

<p>Starting with <code>circle10k.txt</code> if nearest is called with <code>p = (0.81, 0.30)</code> 
the number of nodes visited in order to find that K is nearest is 6.

<center><b>Possible Progress Steps</b></center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>

These are purely suggestions for how you might make progress.  You do
not have to follow these steps.

</p><ol>


<p></p><li><b>Node data type.</b>
There are several reasonable ways to represent a node in a 2d-tree.
One approach is to include the point, a link to the left/bottom subtree,
a link to the right/top subtree, and an axis-aligned rectangle corresponding
to the node.

<blockquote>
<pre>private static class Node {
   private Point2D p;      // the point
   private RectHV rect;    // the axis-aligned rectangle corresponding to this node
   private Node lb;        // the left/bottom subtree
   private Node rt;        // the right/top subtree
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

Unlike the <code>Node</code> class for <code>BST</code>, this <code>Node</code> class is
static because it does not refer to a generic <code>Key</code> or <code>Value</code> type
that depends on the object associated with the outer class. This saves the 
8-byte inner class object overhead. (Making the <code>Node</code> class static 
in <code>BST</code> is also possible if you make the <code>Node</code> type itself
generic as well).
Also, since we don't need to implement
the rank and select operations, there is no need to store the subtree size.

<p></p></li><li><b>Writing KdTree.</b>
Start by writing <code>isEmpty()</code> and <code>size()</code>. These should be very easy. From there, 
write a simplified version of insert() which does everything except set up the
<code>RectHV</code> for each node. Write the <code>contains()</code> method, and use this to test that
<code>insert()</code> was implemented properly. Note that <code>insert()</code> and <code>contains()</code> 
are best implemented by using private helper methods analogous to those found on page 399
of the book or by looking at BST.java. We recommend using orientation as an 
argument to these helper methods.

<p>Now add the code to <code>insert()</code> which sets up the RectHV for each Node. Next,
write <code>draw()</code>, and use this to test these rectangles. Finish up KdTree with the 
nearest and range methods. Finally, test your implementation using our interactive client 
programs as well as any other tests you'd like to conduct.

</p></li></ol>

<center><b>Optimizations</b></center>
</font></td></tr></tbody></table>
</p><p>

These are many ways to improve performance of your 2d-tree. Here are some ideas.

</p><ul>

<p></p><li><b>Squared distances.</b>
Whenever you need to compare two Euclidean distances, it is often more efficient
to compare the squares of the two distances to avoid the expensive
operation of taking square roots.
Everyone should implement this optimization because it is both easy to do
and likely a bottleneck.

<p></p></li><li><b>Range search.</b>
Instead of checking whether the query rectangle intersects the rectangle corresponding
to a node, it suffices to check only whether the query rectangle intersects
the splitting line segment: if it does,
then recursively search both subtrees; otherwise, recursively search the
one subtree where points intersecting the query rectangle could be.

<p></p></li><li><b>Save memory.</b>
You are not required to explicitly store a <code>RectHV</code> in each 2d-tree node (though it
is probably wise in your first version).
